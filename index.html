<h1>Climate change in New York City</h1>   


<p  class= "left-float"> Our usage of fossil fuels since the industrial revolution has caused the climate to change. Increasing average yearly temperatures by over 7 degrees farenheit in the most dire scanarios. This is from a process now as the greenhouse effect. According to Britannica the greenhouse effect is "a warming of Earth’s surface and troposphere (the lowest layer of the atmosphere) caused by the presence of water vapour, carbon dioxide, methane, and certain other gases in the air". This will have profound effects on our city. From increased flood risk to more frequent heat waves, the city will need a comprehesive plan to save it's low lying areas and keep its people protected. </p>
