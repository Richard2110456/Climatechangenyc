<p> This has caused increased temperatures in the New York area. It has caused increased percipaitation. Subsequently it has caused increased flooding. An example can be seen in tropical storm Henri.The storm brought historic flash flooding to the New York area and set new records for rainfall in central park. Most of the city recieved between 2.5 and 5 inches of rain in about a 6 hour period. All of this rain caused a flash flood in multiple places around the city and caused millions in flood damage. The city was not ready for this amount of rain as it was far more than anyone was expecting. This storm like many tropical storm, came to NYC from the Carribean. These types of storm are fed by warm water, thuis warmer waters allow these types of storms to keep some intensity they may have lost otherwise to more northern latitudes. This is where climate change comes in. If humans hadn't raised the global tempertures, that storm would have been weaker and caused less damage.  </p>

<p>This is an video of hurricane Sandy's storm track, and an image of flooding on the FDR drive after hurricane Sandy. It is completely undrivable, this sight will become more and more common later this century as storm of this magnitude happen at a more regular rate. This cvosted the city billions in repairs and lost economic activity. The city need a plan the make sure that in cases of storms like this, the city isn't untraversable for multiple days.</p>
