    <br>
    <p> Some future effects include causing the sea levels to rise. Seas along the coast New York City will rise anywhere from one to three and a half feet by 2080 at a cost of billions of dollars in lost property and assets, drowning some parts of the city. There will also be an increase in flash flooding. Storm surges affecting shoreline properties will increase by as much as 15 feet.  And more heat waves in the summer.To combat these effects as a society we need to adapt. This includes building walls on coasts to stop flooding. And having more centers with air conditioning open in the summers.</p>
