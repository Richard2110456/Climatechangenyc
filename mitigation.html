    <p>To slow climate change further, we must take major action now. This includes decarbonizing our energy production. Eliminating fossil fuels. How much each fuel source emmited is measure in its carbon intensity. This is, the amount of carbon by weight emitted per unit of energy consumed.</p>

<body> <p> As you can see from this chart fossil fuel have an immense carbon intensity, meaning, to generate energy in this way puts lots of carbon into that atomsphere. The cleanest fossil fuel (natural gas) is nearly 10x as polluting is the most carbon intense non-fossil fuel. To slow climate change we must transition to these fuels as quickly as possible as the lower carbon output will slow the greenhouse effect and sea level rise. </p>
